# CAPTCHA-DS
It's a collective intelligence project to build a CAPTCHA dataset

The images you want to work with are defined in the `01.working` directory. You can rename the image file to the number indicated by the four-digit captcha. However, if you already have a file with the same name, you must specify the file name in the format `{captcha}.{number}.png`. Once the operation is complete, you can move it to the `02.labeled` directory.

Some of the completed work in `02.labeled` may be transferred to the `03.verified` directory through further verification, which can be contributed by any part of the process.
